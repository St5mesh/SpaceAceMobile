    "description": "Players describe their character\u2019s actions and declare the desired impact. The referee sets the difficulty and assesses the risk: big ambitions mean higher difficulty and risk. To resolve a risky, dangerous or uncertain action, roll a d20. If the result is equal to or higher than the difficulty, the action succeeds; otherwise it fails. A natural 20 is a Triumph, often granting a new knack related to the action; a natural 1 is a Catastrophe with major fallout. In parallel with every d20 roll, always roll a d6 to determine unintended side\u2011effects. Rolling 1\u20132 on this effect die produces a Snag (a negative complication) and increases the mission\u2019s Heat level by 1. Rolling 5\u20136 produces a Benefit (a positive side\u2011effect) regardless of success or failure.",

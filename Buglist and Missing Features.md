**Buglist and Missing Features**

**Bugs**

- Add module button is present after ship creation, but does nothing when clicked. Add text entry box when clicked, saving each entry as a seperate 'module' and ensure this carries over to the character sheet. Permit the changing of text for existing modules, and allow deletion of modules from the ship page.
- There is no way to delete items from the journal (so accidental clicks on planets and systems within the galaxy map get saved in the play record)
- The tools for manually adjusting the galaxy map are still not present and/or correctly implemented. Remove previous attempts at implementation and instead, add and implement 'swap' and 'delete' buttons within the box for each of the elements in the tabulated list below the galaxy map. At the end of this list  add and implement a 'Add' button to expand the galaxy map and/or replace deleted hex tiles.

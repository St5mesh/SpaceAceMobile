**Buglist and Missing Features**

**Bugs**

- Add module button is present after ship creation, but does nothing when clicked. Add text entry box when clicked, saving each entry as a seperate 'module' and ensure this carries over to the character sheet. Permit the changing of text for existing modules, and allow deletion of modules from the ship page.
